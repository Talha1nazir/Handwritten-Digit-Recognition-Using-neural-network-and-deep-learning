# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-neural-network-and-deep-learning
This project is an implementation of core concepts from Neural Networks and Deep Learning, focusing on building and training neural networks from scratch in Python. It serves as an educational resource to understand how neural networks work without relying heavily on advanced frameworks.
# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples for my book on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

The code is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. There is a version for 
Python 3.8-3.10 [here](https://github.com/unexploredtest/neural-networks-and-deep-learning). 
I will not be updating the current repository for Python 3 compatibility.

The program `src/network3.py` uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the Theano
library.  It needs modification for compatibility with later versions
of the library.  I will not be making such modifications.

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel
free to fork and modify the code.
